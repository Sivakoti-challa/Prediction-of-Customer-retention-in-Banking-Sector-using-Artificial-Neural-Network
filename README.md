# Prediction-of-Customer-retention-in-Banking-Sector-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
The aim is to present perdition and risk accuracy analysis of customer retention in the banking sector. The neural network is a learning model inspired by biological neuron it is used to estimate and predict that can depend on a large number of inputs.  The bank customer dataset from repository, used for data analysis method to extract informative data set from a large volume of the dataset. This dataset is used in the neural network for training data and testing data. In a training of data, the data set is iterated till the desired output. This training data is cross check with test data. This focuses on predicting d customer by using Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm.
